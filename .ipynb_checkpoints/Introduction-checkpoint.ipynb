    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the FLUX pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the FLUX pipeline is to provide a standardised tutorial for using some of the most common toolboxes to analyse full MEG datasets, including SQUID- and OPM-based systems. The pipeline will serve both educational purposes and offer a shared framework for MEG data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This FLUX pipeline is based on [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html). The key reasons for using MNE-Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MNE-Python is supported by an active and dynamic group of developers, ensuring that the latest analysis tools are continuously available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MNE-Python is open source and therefore aligned with Open Science principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The toolbox is built on Python, which is free to use (unlike proprietary alternatives such as MATLAB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is becoming the preferred programming language for innovative data analysis approaches, including a wide range of machine learning tools. Python modules are under constant development by a large open-source community, ensuring access to state-of-the-art data science resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target users\n",
    "\n",
    "The target users are researchers new to MNE-Python as well as more advanced users seeking to standardise their analyses. The FLUX pipeline is particularly geared towards cognitive and clinical neuroscientists with an interest in task-based paradigms. The developers of the pipeline are cognitive neuroscientists with a strong interest in brain oscillations and multivariate approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the pipeline in self-studies and education\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNE Python toolbox has an excellent selection of [Tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html)\n",
    " and [Examples](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_examples/index.html). Nevertheless, the options are so many that the learning curve for new users is very steep. The FLUX pipeline provides a set of procedures for what we consider best practice at this moment in time. Consistent with an Open Science approach, the FLUX pipeline provides a validated and documented approach for MEG data analysis. Each analysis step comes with explanations and illustrations. Furthermore, questions are embedded in the tutorials, which will be useful for self-study or they can be used in educational settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not link back to sections on the MNE Python webpage as they will change over time; nevertheless, users are strongly encouraged to consult the website as they develop their skills and insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the FLUX toolbox, we recommend using the standalone installers: [MNE installation](https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyther notebooks are available from Github (see [FLUX website](https://neuosc.com/flux/)); alternatively copy/paste the code from Github and execute using IDEs e.g. Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create forward models based on T1 MRIs for source modelling [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) is required.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data set ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for the FLUX based on MNE Python is available on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004346/versions/1.0.2). The dataset is used in the step-by-step tutorials. The data are recorded from a simple paradigm on spatial attention. The participants are asked to attend moving gratings in the left or right hemifield. The task and stimulation produce robust modulations in the alpha and gamma bands. \n"
